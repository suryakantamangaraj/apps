export const genericPrivacyPolicy = `This Privacy Policy applies to this application. I built this tool to be transparent and respect your digital footprint. This document outlines exactly what data is collected and how it is utilized.

Data Collection & Usage:
This application is designed to minimize data collection. The vast majority of data processing occurs locally on your device.

• Local Storage: Configurations and preferences are stored locally utilizing standard browser or operating system APIs.
• Analytics: No third-party tracking or analytics SDKs are embedded.
• API Communication: If the app interacts with an external API, only the strictly necessary payload is transmitted.

Third-Party Services:
This tool does not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties. Any interaction with external services is strictly facilitated through your own authenticated sessions and follows their respective privacy agreements.

Your Controls:
You have total control over your data. Because data is stored locally, uninstalling the application or clearing local storage will immediately purge all related configurations.

Contact:
If you have questions about this specific policy or the implementation details, feel free to reach out via my main site or GitHub repository.`;
